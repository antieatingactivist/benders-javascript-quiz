# Bender's Javascript Quiz


## https://antieatingactivist.github.io/futurama-quiz/

This is a Javascript Fundamental Quiz, hosted by me, Bender. It can be easily repurposed for other quiz types with the use of an Object holding all of the question and answer combinations.

- The question object

```
var questions = [{

    q: "Which is NOT a data type?",
    choices: ["string","boolean","alert","number"],
    correctAnswer: 2
},{ //......

```

- DOM manipulation

` var generateBtn = document.querySelector("#generate"); `

- Browser alerts

` prompt("Invalid selection. Lets try this again. How many characters? (must be 8 - 128)"); `
